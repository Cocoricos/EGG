# EGG Protocol

## Short Description

EGG Protocol generates gradual returns by enabling assets escrowing on cross-chain smart contracts.

Cocoricos.io enables frictionless access to decentralized finance (DeFi). Best-in-class proof of liquidity, soft staking, and proof of stake (PoS) assets are grouped together around a single interface.

This repository contains the EGG Token implementation and its set of smart contracts for a staking, voting and periodic token burns and a lockable token distribution.
